No one told me! 

No one told me that I could get paid to do math gymnastics in my head. Or that it would be valuable to think of ways to classify data. Or that people *compete and collaborate* on a platform (hello, Kaggle!) to solve problems with data. And visualizations!? Don't get me started on that! I remember in 2011 I made beautiful maps of the US healthcare system for fun. Yes, for fun!

Imagine my face when my my cousin's friend casually mentioned he was doing a bootcamp in data science. Let me recreate the scene for you:


#### Scene 1
[A dimly lit bar in the late hours. It is noisy, but the trio appears to be deep in conversation despite the noise]

**Pedro**: Data science!? What do you *mean* data science?
**Nick**   : That's what I said. Data science. Like, science with data. You take some data and do some science on it.
**Fed**     : Okay, it's not exactly like that. You don't just "science the data". But yes, Nick's right. Its programming and statistics lumped into one career. Nick, what're you doing this through?
**Nick**   : Oh, it's one of those bootcamps. Like the coding bootcamps, but for this.
**Pedro**: They have bootcamps for this? What? I've been doing this for years! God, I have to get into one of those.
[ Pedro pulls out his phone and frantically starts searching for options ]
**Nick**   : [Laughs] Oh no, there goes the night.
#### End Scene

Needless to say, I've started (and nearly completed) the journey to becoming a data scientist. The best part? It's exactly what I thought it would be.
